## Technologies

This Game is browser-based, meaning that a browser program (ex. Chrome, Firefox, etc.) is required to play it.
<br />
Therefore, for its development some of the most modern and popular Web Technologies were used.

## Game's Purpose
The primary objective of our web browser game is to provide an engaging and educational platform for players to grasp the importance of transitioning to greener energy solutions.
<br />
<br />
By simulating real-world scenarios and presenting various renewable energy alternatives, this game aims to increase awareness of the environmental, economic, and social benefits of adopting clean energy sources over fossil fuels.
<br />
<br />
Through this interactive experience, we hope to inspire and empower individuals to make informed decisions and become advocates for a sustainable future.
<br />
<br />

## Gameplay
In the game, players assume the role of the mayor of a small town, their task is to increase the town‚Äôs residents by constructing buildings and powering them through renewable energy generators.

To create these structures, players must gather essential materials by assigning professions to the town‚Äôs people. Currently, four professions are available: accounting (which generates gold), concrete gathering, metals mining, and crystals harvesting.

Various buildings in the game offer unique benefits, effects or abilities, such as increasing resource gathering rates or resource conversion. However, these buildings need electricity to function, which can be found from renewable energy generators. Players must carefully manage their energy infrastructure to keep their town thriving.

A key element in the game is the living standards score, which represents the growth rate of the town's population. This score is inversely proportional to the population, meaning that as the number of residents increases, it becomes more challenging to grow the town further. Specialised buildings can help boost the living standards score, facilitating a sustainable population growth.
<br />
<br />

## Player's Goal (Reason to play the game)
The player‚Äôs ultimate goal is to earn MyGreenScore tokens, which behave as digital currency for the platform's eco-system. These tokens then can be redeemed for various goods and services depending on the player's real-world location.

To begin accumulating these tokens, players must first secure a position among the top 100 players of the game. In addition, the higher one is placed in the leaderboard, the greater the rewards become.

To increase engagement, a competitive element was inserted. Only the top 100 players will have the privilege of earning the MyGreenScore (MGS) crypto tokens. Futhermore, the higher one is placed in the leaderboard rankings, the greater the rewards are.

## Dev Space üë®‚Äçüíª
Following are some of the most important files in the project's directory.
1. **PlayerContext.jsx** (./src/context/playerContext/PlayerContext.jsx)
<br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
In this file is where the most vital piece of code for any game resides, **The Game Loop**.
    - The Game Loop, is responsible for calculating the:
      - Player's stats
      - Gathering rates
      - Special effects' boosts & timers
      - Performs value checking (a simple anti-cheat system)
      - Buildings' and REGs' maintance costs
      - Update the Database, to keep the UI and the Database in sync
      
   Other important porcesses that take place here are:
      - New Player's Stats Initiation
      - The control of the sequence of the 4 steps required to load the app
      - The Creation of the 2 Smart Contract instances (created by ethers.js) to link the game with the blockchain
      
2. **Blockchain Related**
<br />  &nbsp;&nbsp;
There are 4 places in this project related with the Web3 Cosmos (Blockchain)
- **useMetaMask.jsx** (./src/context/useMetaMask.jsx)
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;
This context provides the following functionality for the rest of the app to consume:

    - If there is a crypto wallet installed 
    - The wallet information (address, chainId, balance)
    - If the context has finished executing its code (used to control the app's code execution flow)
    - The "Connect Wallet" functionality
    - The "Switch Network" functionality
    - The "Add Network" functionality
    
- **useContract.jsx** (./src/hooks/useContract.jsx)
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;
This custom react hook simplifies the process of creating a Contract Instance through the ethers.js lib.
<br />
By providing the deployed contract's information (address and ABI) and the user's crypto wallet (provider)
<br />
It return a a function that can be used to initialize the contract's instace. 
<br />
In turn, this function returns the desired contract instace.
<br />
<br />
Let's see an example to better understand how it works.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect} from from 'react';
// Import the hook
import useContract from '../../hooks/useContract.jsx';

// Create a state variable to store the contract
const [contract, setContract] = useState(null);

// call it, this is how all React hooks work
const { initialize, isLoading } = useContract(
    provider,
    contractRewardingAddress,
    RewardingABI
  );
  
// Probaly you want to use the "initialize" function inside a useEffect hook like this
useEffect(() => {
    /* 
    * if wallet detection code has run AND 
    * wallet is connected AND
    * wallet is on the correct network
    */
    if (hasMetaMaskRun && hasProvider && wallet.chainId === 20231) {
      (async () => {
        try {
          console.log('Initializing Rewarding Contract Instance...');
          const _contract = await initialize();
          setContract(_contract);
          console.log('‚úÖ Contract Instance Completed!');
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('‚ùå From: (PlayerContext), useEffect: ', error);
        }
      })(); // This weird syntax is called IIFE (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)
```

    - If there is a crypto wallet installed 
    - The wallet information (address, chainId, balance)
    - If the context has finished executing its code (used to control the app's code execution flow)
    - The "Connect Wallet" functionality
    - The "Switch Network" functionality
    - The "Add Network" functionality
